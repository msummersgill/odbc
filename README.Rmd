Cheers to all the folks at who worked hard on the [odbc](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc) package, batch insert performance on SQL Server is top notch! However, for the sake of my own uses, I eliminated a couple features I don't use that require an additional 11 dependencies.

No blob/time support, but no dependency on blob, hms, tibble, pillar, rlang, cli, crayon, asserthat, utf8, and pkgconfig packages
